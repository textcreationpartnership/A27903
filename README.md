#The voice of thunder, or, The sound of a trumpet giving a certain sound, saying, Arise ye dead, and come to judgement the light, to guide you to judge out the evil, that righteousnesse you may learn, and so come to have a true discerning betwixt the precious and the vile, betwixt those that in truth serve the Lord, and those that pretend to worship him, a day, when in truth they serve him not, but grieve his spirit : with a few words to them whose faces are Sion-ward, travelling to the good land of rest, whereunto those that believe not in the light cannot enter : with a dear, tender visitation to the holy, meek, suffering seed, which is already entered and entering in, where none can make afraid / by Humphrey Bache.#
